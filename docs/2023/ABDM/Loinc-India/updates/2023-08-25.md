## Learnings

- I've learned how to integrate third-party authentication services like Google OAuth into your application. This allows users to sign in securely using their Google accounts.

- By implementing Google sign-in, i have gained insights into the authentication workflow, including obtaining user credentials, handling authentication tokens, and managing user sessions.

- With separate verification for particular email IDs, i have learned how to control access to specific features or content based on user identity. This adds a layer of user-specific functionality.
