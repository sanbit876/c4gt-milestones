## Summary
Added 3 more languages to the bot. This week I was facing problems with improving the UI of bot, I integrated Dialogflow with Kommunicate to simplify the process. Added buttons using rich text features. Created language selection feature and also added various suggestions for each question. Since I linked kommunicate to Dialogflow at this stage I had to make changes to existing intents and edit follow up intents for a few languages.
